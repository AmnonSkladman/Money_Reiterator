# Money_Reiterator
Created with CodeSandbox as a side-project.

# Usage
Enter an amount using digits only, and it will acts like a bank, showing you how many bills and coins you would receive, starting at the biggest ones and working their way down. For example, if you enter 485, then you'd get 100 x4, 50 x1, 20 x1, 10 x1, 5 x1. And so on and so forth.
